                                digital
                                balance
                                of the Syrian diasporic refugees in Belgium. This is done firstly by establishing a
                                detailed
                                understanding of the Syrian diasporic refugees’ experience in relation to social media
                                connectivity
                                and dis-connectivity. In other words, their social media usage and their attempts to
                                reduce
                                it
                                or to
                                dis-connect from social media. Secondly, we seek to reveal the nature of their motives
                                to
                                connect to
                                social media and whether their social media motives are ruled by intrinsic or extrinsic
                                stimuli
                                or a
                                combination of both. Thirdly, we achieve this goal by critically reviewing and listening
                                to
                                their
                                perception of digital well-being and digital balance, their tools and methods that help
                                them
                                to
                                preserve a sense of digital well-being or digital balance. Finally, this research
                                contributes to
                                the
                                understanding of Syrian diasporic refugees’ perceived digital balance by developing a
                                more
                                thorough
                                examination of the emotional dimension of the social media connectivity paradox. Aiming
                                at
                                understanding people’s experiences, values and emotions requires the research to employ
                                a
                                qualitative research design by using in-depth interviews as a research method to examine
                                the
                                digital

                                in relation to home, belonging and refugees diaspora. However, this article concentrates

                                the
